## Basic terminology
* **File system:** The  way files are stored and organized
* **Current directory:** The directory where you are at the moment
* **parent directory:** you can move forward to a subdirectory or backwards to the previous directory
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** When you open the file manager, your current working directory is your home directory. While every user in the system has a home directory.
* **pathname:** indicates the location of the file in the filesystem
* **relative path:** the location of a file starting a the root of the file system
* **absolute path:** the location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory
