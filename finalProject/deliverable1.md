## Other Relevant Concepts
* **Protocol**
A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers. Communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data that is being exchanged. The set of rules that defines a format is called a protocol.


* **TCP**
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is an important network protocol that lets two hosts connect and exchange data streams. TCP guarantees the delivery of data and packets in the same order as they were sent. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, who were DARPA scientists at the time, designed TCP in the 1970s.


* **Virtual hosts**
A packet, or network packet, is a formatted chunk of data sent over a network. The main components of a network packet are the user data and control information.
* **Log file**
an event that took place at a certain time and might have metadata that contextualizes it
